# barcodeBulk

## Description

A quick and dirty [Electron](http://electron.atom.io) tool used to generate and print a page (A4) of barcode (hardcoded CODE 128) with a Title.

The use of this program was to ease the work of some people i work with who do daily scanning of clothes they deliver to customers.

Their goal was to have a few A4 pages with a bunch of barcodes so they have a centralize place to scan needed barcodes.


Thanks to the [Electron Boilerplate repository](https://github.com/szwacz/electron-boilerplate) and the js library [JsBarcode](https://github.com/lindell/JsBarcode) the program was quickly build.


I appoligize for the code cleanness which was clearly not my goal (done in a few hours, i didn't even removed unit tests, there is tons of dead code, etc.)


I only place this here if it can help somebody with maybe the same need.


## Usage

### Build / Improve

Please refer to the original documentation available on [Electron Boilerplate repository](https://github.com/szwacz/electron-boilerplate)).

### Pre compiled binaries

Since it is a ready to use tool, i will let the latest build binary available within the `dist` directory in this repository for easy use if someone fall on this webpage one day :).
